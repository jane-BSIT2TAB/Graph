1. Make a simple useful JAVA console application that uses a graph.


2. Document your application.
 Introduce what is it.
=This Java console application demonstrates Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph.  The graph represents a simplified road network, where vertices are locations and edges represent roads with associated weights (distances).
 Describe what it can do.
=The app lets users:

1. Choose how many points (places) are in the road system.
2. Enter the roads and their lengths. The format to use is: start_point end_point length.
3. Pick a starting point (the source).
4. Find and show the shortest distances from the starting point to every other point in the system. If a point can’t be reached, it shows "Infinity.”
 Answer why did you make that kind  of application and How does it contribute to you or to the community.
=I decided to use Dijkstra's algorithm because it's a basic yet effective way to find the shortest paths in graphs with weights. This application helps in several ways:

- Educational: It gives a hands-on example of graph algorithms and data structures in Java. Students can learn how Dijkstra's algorithm works and how to apply it.
- Clear: It shows a simple and straightforward example of a common graph problem and how to solve it.
- Building Block: It can be used as a starting point for more complex situations, like working with real road networks or adding features such as visual aids or different pathfinding methods (like A*).
